# Project3
MergeSort vs Quicksort for airplane departures.

This program compares the efficiency of QuickSort vs Merge Sort, while also 
providing functionailuty regarding
Airplane departures. Hypothetically, this could be used to sort real-time 
data of airpline flight delays as they update on a public database. 
For this project we used Flight Delay Data for U.S. Airports by 
Carrier August 2013 - August 2023 via Kaggle.com

The csv zip file attached should be downloaded into the users compiler of choice. 
This program uses relative path for the filename, but if an issue persists,
I recommend copying the file as a direct path for the program.
